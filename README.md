1. What is a benefit of using the Git CLI rather than a GUI?

The Git CLI is faster and more efficient than a GUI, since you can type commands more quickly than you can click through menus and dialog boxes.

The Git CLI is more powerful than a GUI, since it allows you to access all of Git's features and functionality, whereas a GUI may only expose a subset of these features.

The Git CLI is more flexible than a GUI, since you can use it on any operating system and in any environment where you have access to a terminal, whereas GUIs are usually specific to a particular platform.

The Git CLI is more scriptable and automatable than a GUI, since you can use it in conjunction with other tools to create custom workflows and automate repetitive tasks.

The Git CLI is more portable than a GUI, since you can easily copy and paste commands from one machine to another, whereas GUIs are tied to the specific machine on which they are installed.

2. What is the Git command to send your code to Github?

git push

3. What does the -m in a Git commit command mean or do?

In Git, the -m option is used to specify a commit message when performing a commit. When you run the git commit command without this option, Git will open your default text editor and ask you to enter a commit message.

4. What is the Git command for making a commit?

In Git, the git commit command is used to create a commit, which is a snapshot of your repository at a particular point in time. When you make a commit, you are recording the state of your repository, including all of your modified files and any new files that you have added.

5. What is the Git command to select the files you want to add to a commit?

To select the files that you want to include in a commit, you will need to use the git add command. This command is used to stage files for a commit, which means that it prepares the files to be included in the next commit.

6. What is the Git command to see changes you have waiting to be committed?

To see the changes that you have waiting to be committed in Git, you can use the git diff command with the --staged option. This command shows you the differences between the files in your staging area and the most recent commit.

7. What is the Git command to get changes from Github onto your computer?
