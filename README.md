1. What is a benefit of using the Git CLI rather than a GUI?

The Git CLI is faster and more efficient than a GUI, since you can type commands more quickly than you can click through menus and dialog boxes.

The Git CLI is more powerful than a GUI, since it allows you to access all of Git's features and functionality, whereas a GUI may only expose a subset of these features.

The Git CLI is more flexible than a GUI, since you can use it on any operating system and in any environment where you have access to a terminal, whereas GUIs are usually specific to a particular platform.

The Git CLI is more scriptable and automatable than a GUI, since you can use it in conjunction with other tools to create custom workflows and automate repetitive tasks.
