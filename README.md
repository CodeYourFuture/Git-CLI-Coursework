1. What is a benefit of using the Git CLI rather than a GUI?

The big downside of using GUI for Git is that it exposes you to a relatively small interface (whatever part the GUI creator deemed important), this basically means you are not fully interacting with Git and are therefore not familiar with (at least) some of its capabilities.

Navigating through different icons makes the GUI slow. Thus CLI offers better speed as commands are directly given to the computer. So many professionals preferred CLI because of its speed and performance. Sometimes professionals are required to work in more than two languages.
