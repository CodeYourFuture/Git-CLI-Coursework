1. What is a benefit of using the Git CLI rather than a GUI?
<!-- Write your answer here -->
Due to a higher degree of memorization and familiarity needed for operation and navigation, new users find operating a command line interface more difficult than a GUI.

Users have a good bit of control over both the file and operating systems in a command line interface. However, for new or novice users, it is not as user-friendly as a GUI.

Although many command line environments are capable of multitasking, they do not offer the same ease and ability to view multiple things at once on one screen.	

Command line users only need to utilize a keyboard to navigate the interface, often resulting in faster performance.

A computer that is only using the command line takes a lot less of the computer's system resources than a GUI.

A command line interface mostly requires users to already know scripting commands and syntax, making it difficult for new or novice users to create scripts.

When accessing another computer or device over a network, a user can manipulate the device or its files with a command line interface. However, you must know the commands to do so and is not as easy for new or novice users.	

After you've learned how to navigate and use a command line, it's not going to change as much as a new GUI. Although new commands may be introduced, the original commands often remain the same.	

A command line interface is often very basic and can be more of a strain on a user's vision. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome can also be a bit of a risk when using a command line interface because users are only using a keyboard. There is little need to change hand positions and strain to the wrists or even fingers can occur.	

You can use it (Git CLI) remotely across the Internet with much less bandwidth.

CONCLUSION:
Overall, a GUI is used by more users today than a CLI. Dedicated and hard core programmers may lean towards using a CLI for efficiency and speed, but the GUI is more user-friendly and preferred by most users.
