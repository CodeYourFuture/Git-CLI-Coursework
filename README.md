1. What is a benefit of using the Git CLI rather than a GUI?

Git CLI has many more features compared to GUI. GUI may only have limited features or only the most important ones. However, Git CLI has more flexibility and enables us to access all features there are in GIT. Therefore, Git CLI is a much better option to use for GIT.

2. What is the Git command to send your code to Github?

In order to send our work to our remote repository on Github, we use "git push" for it.

3. What does the -m in a Git commit command mean or do?

Usually, git commit should contain a description message with each commit so we can keep track of what changes we have made to the files being committed. The -m refers to that message. which we add in quotation marks after this -m.

4. What is the Git command for making a commit?

In order to commit our changes, we use "git commit" for it.

5. What is the Git command to select the files you want to add to a commit?

Before we commit our changes, we need to select the files we want to add to that commit. By adding those files, we bring them to the staging area to be committed. In order to add the files, we use git add along with the file names. If we want to add all the files at once, we can use "git add .". However, if there are too many files, it is not recommended.

6. What is the Git command to see changes you have waiting to be committed?

We can use git status to check our file status, whether it has been added and needs to be committed. If there are no changes at all, git status will still tell us that there is nothing to be committed or added.

7. What is the Git command to get changes from Github onto your computer?

I believe in order to get changes from our Github onto our local machine, we can use git pull for it.
